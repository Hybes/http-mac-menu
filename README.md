# HTTP Request Display for Mac System Tray

## Download/Releases

For releases, download the DMG for Intel or Apple Silicon in the Releases page or at the bottom of the README.

## Usage

The app only runs in the tray and uses your configuration to show the result in the Menu Bar at the top of the screen.

You can then close the settings window. Don't CMD-Q as it will quit the whole app, you just need to press the 'X'.

## Troubleshooting
